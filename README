Usage: SimpleCSharp.exe <input file>

Description

Write a C# program that takes a file of text (named "simple.txt") as input. The file will only contain alphabetic characters and whitespace. The program should print a list of the distinct words in the file, together with a count of the number of times that word appeared. Each word should appear on a separate line, followed by its count, with the two separated by a tab. The words should be displayed in lower-case, regardless of their case in the original input file. The output should be sent to the console.


For purposes of this assignment, a word is any sequence of contiguous alphabetic characters (a-zA-Z). Ignore case when matching words ("The" and "the" are considered the same word in the example below). Whitespace separates words but are otherwise ignored.

The output list can be in any order.

You must use a Common Language Runtime generic collection in your program.

The purpose of this assignment is to go through whatever processes you need to set up a C# compiler and write a basic C# program, including basic use of the collection classes provided in the Common Language Runtime (CLR).

Example input file

This is a test of what the test program might produce
The file will test the program
Example output (one of several possible orders)

The sequence ' \t ' indicates a tab character.

this \t 1
is \t 1
a \t 1
test \t 3
of \t 1
what \t 1
the \t 3
program \t 2
might \t 1
produce \t 1
file \t 1
will \t 1
